The code, so far, interprets a demand from the body for a monomeric protein, and tells it which amino acids make up that protein.
It then forms the sequence of codons that make up the amino acids needed (including the stop codon). In the end, it creates a DNA strand with all the codons for all the required proteins. 

The data files contain a dictionary telling which codon forms a given amino acid and the genetic code for the monomeric proteins,
which is still incomplete (I need to add the genetic code for all the proteins). 

I need to create classes for oligomer proteins (with more than one peptide chain)
